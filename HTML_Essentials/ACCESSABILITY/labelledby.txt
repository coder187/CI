The aria-labelledby attribute

The aria-labelledby attribute establishes relationships between objects and their labels. The value given to the aria-labelledby attribute should be one or more element IDs, which refer to elements that have the text needed for labelling.

Screen readers use this attribute to catalogue the objects in a document so that users can navigate between them. Without an element ID, the assistive technology cannot catalog the object.

The reason for this is to provide names for regions of a page that can be read by assistive technology. The aria-labelledby attribute associates a section of the page marked up as a region or landmarks with text that is on the page. The landmarks help assistive technology users orient themselves to a page and help them navigate easily to various sections of a page.

For example:

<div aria-labelledby="heading-one heading-two">
<h1 id="heading-one">First heading</h1>
<p>Paragraph text here...</p>
<h2 id="heading-two">Second heading</h2>
<p>More paragraph text here...</p>
</div>

The aria-labelledby attribute also works to label image-based elements in the same way that the for attribute works to label a form element.

When a project has a photograph, illustration, animation, diagram or another visual component within it, the same page may also contain a text description of this element. When this is the case, the aria-labelledby attribute can be used to identify that these two elements - the visual media and the text description - go together.

The value of the aria-labelledby attribute corresponds directly to the value of the id for the element or elements that describe it.

If you can use the aria-labelledby attribute on an <img> element, its alt attribute should be an empty value.

For example:

<img src="diagram.png" alt="" aria-labelledby="diagram-description conclusion">
<p id="diagram-description">The diagram above shows ...</p>
<p id="conclusion">We can draw the following conclusions ...</p>

It is not necessary to use aria-label if aria-labelledby can be used if both are included screenreaders will always give precedence to aria-labelledby.
