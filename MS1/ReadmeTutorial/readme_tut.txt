User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project
Project purpose: Presentation of static data
In this project, you’ll build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that you have learned about so far.

Value provided:
Data is presented in a way that helps users achieve their goals, e.g. learning about a product/service that they are interested in.
The presentation of this data advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.


Project Requirements
Main Technologies
Required: HTML, CSS

Optional: Bootstrap and/or other CSS libraries/frameworks.

Mandatory Requirements
A project violating any of these requirements will FAIL

Static front end project: Write custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.
Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.



Avoiding Plagiarism
Plagiarism, as defined by the Oxford dictionary is “the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own.” It is a serious academic offence for which there are serious consequences.

It is acceptable to use and reference others’ code however it is an academic plagiarism offence if any piece of work which is not entirely the student’s own is not correctly referenced or acknowledged. All student projects submitted will be reviewed for plagiarism. This includes checking code comparison tools, plagiarism software, review of git commit history and other mechanisms.

Principles
It is the responsibility of each student to ensure that any direct or indirect inclusion of the work of others is fully and adequately acknowledged.
We appreciate that plagiarism may be unintentional however it will still be treated as an offence.
The Tutoring team can answer any plagiarism related queries, but as a general rule, if in doubt, include attribution of all sources.
Students are encouraged to ask mentors, tutors and their peers for advice about their project work but any submission should not include any code written by others, unless it is explicitly credited to them.
Any such external well-attributed code would not contribute to a student’s project assessment directly, but may make the overall project more appealing, and as such is in no way discouraged.
Failure to correctly credit code that a student hasn’t created themselves will be considered plagiarism and will result in a failing grade.
Blatant or repeat offences of plagiarism will not be tolerated and will result in stringent penalties being applied, including removal from the course.
Plagiarism Procedure
Code Institute will notify students suspected of plagiarism within 24 hours of identifying the issue.
Code Institute will outline specific instances of plagiarism with reference to the plagiarised material and the suspected source(s).
Students are given 48 hours to respond. Failure to respond will be taken as an admission of plagiarism.
A student who is found to have committed plagiarism, may be permitted to resubmit their project having removed or correctly credited the offending sections of the project where applicable. The grade for the successfully resubmitted project will be capped at the pass mark. The student will not be informed of the actual grade. Code Institute reserves the right to not accept a resubmission and to remove the student from the course.
Appeal
Following review, if a student believes they have been wrongfully accused of plagiarism they may appeal this via written request to submissions@codeinstitute.net. This must be done within 48 hours of the student being informed. The appeal process will be overseen by the Head of Academic Validation & Compliance.


Citing Other people's Code
If you reproduce someone else's work, you should credit it.

There's no issue in borrowing working code if it's the best tool for the job, provided the author's licence conditions allow it - developers do it all the time. But there is a problem if you could be perceived as being at all secretive or deceptive about it. Also, our plagiarism tool is likely to catch it. To avoid that, reference any 3rd party code it both in comments above the code and also in the project README file. Full disclosure means you avoid being accused of doing anything wrong.

Approach
You need to add a comment in your code to make clear the following:
The code you are using is not your original work.
The source location of the code you borrowed, usually indicated with a URL.
For larger dependencies, also refer to the borrowed source in your README file with a short explanation of your intended use and a link to the source.
For 3rd party libraries, refer to the borrowed source in your README file with a short explanation of your intended use and a link to the source.

Assessment Criteria
There are four grade levels for project assessment; Fail, Pass, Merit and Distinction. Your User Centric Front End Development project will be assessed based on it demonstrating the learning outcomes of the course. Each learning outcome has several criteria that have to be met. The purpose of the assessment is to ensure you have understood the lessons. This is done by showing that all 32 pass criteria below are met in the project or documented in the project's README. A further eight criteria are assessed to see if an award greater than a pass can be given.

Learning Outcomes
Learning Outcome	Criterion
LO1	Design a front-end web application based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity
LO2	Develop and implement a static front-end web application using HTML and CSS
LO3	Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation
LO4	Use version control software to maintain, upload and share code with other developers.
LO5	Test and deploy a front-end web application to a Cloud platform
Pass Criteria
All pass criteria for all learning outcomes must be achieved for a pass to be awarded. For example, to meet the LO1 1.6 criterion, any modal must have a close button and any audio file must have a play button. LO2 criterion 2.3 will be a fail if any HTML fails the W3 validator.

LO1 Design a front-end web application based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsive design

1.1	Design a website that incorporates a main navigation menu and a structured layout
1.2	Design a website that meets accessibility guidelines (e.g. contrast between background and foreground colors, non-text elements have planned alt text equivalents to cater for the visually impaired)
1.3	Design the organisation of information on the page following the principles of user experience design (headers are used to convey structure, information is easy to find due to being presented and categorised in terms of priority)
1.4	Ensure that foreground information is never distracted by backgrounds
1.5	Include graphics that are consistent in style and color
1.6	Design the site to allow the user to initiate and control actions such as pop-ups and playing of audio/video.
LO2 Develop & implement a static front-end web application using HTML and CSS

2.1	Create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) at least 3 separate page areas, to match the design and to meet its stated purpose
2.2	Write custom CSS code that passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues
2.3	Write custom HTML code that passes through the official W3C validator with no issues.
2.4	Incorporate images that are of sufficient resolution to not appear pixelated or stretched
2.5	Code all external links to open in a separate tab when clicked
2.6	Use CSS media queries or CSS Grid/Bootstrap across the application to ensure the layout changes appropriately and maintains the page's structural integrity across device screen sizes
2.7	Use Semantic markup to structure HTML code
2.8	Present the finished website with clearly understandable site-specific content, rather than Lorem Ipsum placeholder text
2.9	Implement clear navigation to allow users to find resources on the site intuitively.
LO3 Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation

3.1	Write a README.md file for the web application that explains its purpose, the value that it provides to its users, and the deployment procedure.
3.2	Insert screenshots of the finished project that align to relevant user stories
3.3	Attribute all code from external sources to its original source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
3.4	Clearly separate and identify code written for the website and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials)
3.5	Organise HTML and CSS code into well-defined and commented sections
3.6	Place CSS code in external files, linked to the HTML page in the HEAD element
3.7	Write code that meets at least minimum standards for readability (consistent indentation, blank lines only appear individually or, at most, in pairs)
3.8	Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
3.9	Group files in directories by file type (e.g. an assets directory will contain all static files and may be organized into sub-directories such as CSS, images, etc.)
LO4 Use version control software to maintain, upload and share code with other developers

4.1	Use a cloud-based, git-based, version control system (e.g. Git & GitHub) throughout the development and implementation process
4.2	Document the development process through descriptive commit messages
4.3	Use consistent and effective markdown formatting to produce a README file that is well-structured, easy to follow, and has few grammatical errors
LO5 Test and deploy a front-end web application to a Cloud platform

5.1	Design and implement manual testing procedures to assess functionality, usability and responsiveness
5.2	Document the testing in the README or in a separate file
5.3	Deploy a final version of the code to a cloud-based hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages) and test to ensure it matches the development version
5.4	Remove commented-out code before pushing final files to version control and deploying
5.5	Ensure that there are no broken internal links
Merit Performance
To evidence performance at Merit level, a learner will, in general, demonstrate characteristics of performance at Merit level as outlined below. The learner must achieve ALL Pass and Merit criteria for merit to be awarded.

1.1	Design a website with a flow of information layout, and interaction feedback which is clear and unambiguous
2.1	Implement a website whose purpose is immediately evident to a new user without having to look at supporting documentation.
2.2	Implement a website that provides a good solution to the user story demands and expectations.
3.1	All HTML attribute and CSS rule names are consistent in format, appropriate and meaningful
4.1	Commit often, for each individual feature/fix, ensuring that commits are small and well-defined, with messages that clearly and concisely describe the exact reason for a particular commit.
5.1	Present a clear rationale for the development of the project, in the README, demonstrating that it has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of, and user stories for a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences).
5.4	Document testing fully to include evaluation of bugs found and their fixes and explanation of any bugs that are left unfixed.
5.5	Fully document the development life cycle procedures in the README file.
Explanation of Assessment
Once you submit your milestone project, it will be reviewed by an assessor and graded based on the criteria above. On each criterion, the assessor will review how your project meets this criterion and award you a pass or fail. Written feedback will let you know what you have done well and what needs improvement. Refer to the Assessment Handbook you received by mail when you started this course for more guidance on how to achieve a Merit or Distinction grade.

MAKING THE MOST OF YOUR MENTOR RELATIONSHIP
For students in the Mentored Online Programme, the most critical time for mentoring is during project work. You will need to schedule three structured sessions during your work on the project, in the beginning, middle and end of your effort, to focus on the high-level aspects of constructing your project. These mentoring sessions are mandatory for all Mentored Online students.

Below is a recommended structure for these three half-hour sessions:

Project inception: This is a session where your mentor would help you plan your project work.
Come to this session after going over the project guidelines with (at least) some initial ideas for the project and preferably some user stories and even mockups.
Your mentor will help you decide which parts of your ideas would work best for the project and help you make decisions about the best technologies to implement these plans.
Middle of the project: You should schedule this session for when you feel that the project is mostly done, but some hard parts remain.
A well-known (and entirely accurate) aphorism in software engineering states that:
 The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time. 
Given this difficulty, be sure to ask your mentor for help in reining in the complexity of these remaining “10” percent.
Your mentor will try to help you in thinking about how to approach the remaining problems and may advise you how to reduce the project’s scope if needed.
End of project review: Once your project is ready for final review, schedule a session where you will present it to your mentor, going over both the site itself and the code running it.
Your mentor will give you useful feedback including recommendations for final touches, and will then provide you with a short introduction and welcome to the next stream.

You might also be tempted also to ask your mentor for help with specific technical issues, but that is not the best use of your mentoring time. Instead, we recommend that you ask your mentor for overall feedback on your work and (rather than getting specific issues solved during the session) get the advice you need to be more productive between sessions.

May your project work be challenging, productive and satisfying!


If, after 30 minutes of troubleshooting, you have not resolved an issue in your Milestone Project, then it is recommended for you to contact tutor support.
WHAT IS IT?

An opportunity to get support from developers on troubleshooting technical issues during development of your project.

 
WHAT DOES IT DO?

Tutors will help you to debug issues in your project during development.

 
HOW DO YOU USE IT?

You can use the support tab on the lms in order to be put in contact with tutor support. Please note that tutors are here to help you troubleshoot the issue, but will not write code for you.



MAKING THE MOST OF A TUTOR SESSION
 You get access to tutor support during the course of your subscription. The first 60 minutes in a 7 day window of your time with tutor support is considered priority and your queries will be addressed as soon as possible.
 After that, your queries will be placed in queues depending on the subject matter, and the amount of tutor support time you have already used in the previous 7 days.
 Tutor support runs 24 hours Monday - Friday, and 9am - 5pm GMT Saturday and Sunday. The longest you can expect to wait within these times for a reply is 90 minutes.
 It is advised that you spend 30 minutes troubleshooting your issues yourself when issues arise. Part of being a great developer is the ability to troubleshoot issues through the use of online resources. These skills will be key for gaining that first developer role.
 On opening a query with tutor support, you will first be asked a series of questions by robo-duck, the tutor team’s automated bot. Robo-ducks’s role is twofold. The answers to robo-duck’s questions will provide tutors with all necessary information. Robo-duck is also a ‘Rubber ducking exercise’, where answering robo-duck's questions may lead you to solve the issue for yourself.
 Please provide as much information as possible when answering Robo-duck's questions in order to enable the tutors to help with debugging as soon as possible. Failure to answer these questions may result in delayed responses from the tutors.

COMPLETING YOUR MILESTONE PROJECT:
Your work on the milestone project for this module is ready for submission once you've completed the following steps:

You have completed all of the functional requirements for the project work
You have deployed the project and documented the deployment
You have tested the project extensively and documented your testing
You have written sufficient overall documentation in the README.md file in English
You have correctly set the lang attribute in the HTML to the web apps content language
You have had your final project review session with your mentor and addressed their feedback if any
You have checked you have met all criteria for the learning outcomes in the Assessment Handbook
You are overall happy with your work
SUBMISSION PROCEDURE:
You should submit your milestone project for this module by filling out the form on the Project Submissions page and providing links to both your source code on GitHub and the live deployed project (e.g. on Heroku or GitHub Pages). Submit each project whenever it's ready so that you'll be able to use the assessor's feedback to guide your work on the following projects.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
The source code for your project work will only be accepted through a link to a repository on GitHub which is owned by you and has had no other contributors.

To protect the submitted project code from further alteration, the submitted GitHub repository will be forked into a repository owned by Code Institute, which will then be reviewed by the assessors.

The live link to the site that you submit must be deployed from the source code with no alterations (except those described in the deployment procedure section of your documentation.) No other alterations may be made to the deployed version until you have received your results for all 4 projects and the final grade for your diploma. Any project that does not achieve a passing grade, may be edited for the purpose of a resubmission. Failure to comply with this, will delay the issuing of your final grade and may result in a penalty being applied if any alterations have been made.

GRADE NOTIFICATION:
Results are released 4 weeks after your project submission. You will be sent your results by email.

If you require clarification on the project assessment feedback provided, you can contact student care.

RE-SUBMISSION:
If your project submission does not meet the required standard, you may resubmit your project to achieve a pass. Student Care will liaise with you to arrange the timeframe for a resubmission. The grade for any project resubmitted will be capped at a pass. You will not be informed of the actual grade. The resubmission fee is €50. For any project, the maximum number of resubmission attempts is 2. A student whose project has received a pass mark is not permitted to resubmit their project with a view to achieving a higher grade.

APPEALS:
Where a student feels they have been unfairly marked or that the marking is inconsistent with the assessment criteria, they may appeal their grade. The appeal must be requested in writing to Student Care within 2 weeks of the grade being released. In doing so, you must also outline the grounds on which you are appealing the awarded grade. The project in its previously submitted format will be graded by a different assessor. You may not make any changes to your project (source code or live version) while the appeal process is taking place. The result of the appeal, which may be higher or lower than the original grade will be the final grade awarded. There is a €50 fee for the appeal which will be refunded if the outcome of the appeal is a higher passing grade. The appeal process will be completed within 5 weeks.
