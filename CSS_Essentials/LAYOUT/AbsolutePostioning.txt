Absolute positioning takes an element out of the normal document flow. It is not part of the normal flow of the page. If you add absolute value to a child element, then the parent element will behave as though the child is not there at all. If you then add values for left or bottom, for example, you will see the child element position move with respect to the nearest ancestor element that is not static rather than the parent element.

If we want to position a child element absolutely with respect to its parent, then you need to add position: relative; to the parent. The top, right, bottom, and left properties on the child would then be offsets from the parent element rather than the document.

There are lots of cases in web design when we want to stretch an absolute element horizontally and vertically at the same time. You probably noticed modals, popup boxes that have a dark layer behind. This dark layer is created with absolute or fixed positioning. It covers the whole page, and it is on the top of everything but the modal. To cover all the other elements, it has to be taken out of the flow. Otherwise, it would just follow the default stack order. That is why we need to position it fixed or absolute.
