The purpose of the z-index property is to control the vertical stacking of overlapping elements. A higher z-index value appears to be physically closer to you. Its name comes from the cartesian coordinate system where the x-axis is horizontal, the y-axis is vertical and the z-axis is perpendicular to the screen pointing straight at you.

With no z-index value set the elements stack in the same order as they appear in the HTML. The lowest in the hierarchy will appear closest to you. This also means that if element A is on top of element B, no child element of A can be higher in the stack than element B.
