CSS Pseudo-Classes

A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a specific state of the selected element or elements.

Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator. For example, :visited can apply styles to links that are already in the browser history and therefore have been visited. Pseudo-classes can also target the status of the document content. For example, :checked on a checkbox, or the position of the mouse with :hover. :focus represents an element that has received focus. It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's Tab key. It helps highlight the current element that has been clicked.

When applying a pseudo-class the colon before it tells the browser that it is a pseudo-class it should be looking for, and it is important not to put a space between the pseudo-class and the selector or the two will not be connected.

Pseudo-classes can be applied to any css selector, be it type, class, id or attribute selectors.
