Using margin

The margin property defines the outermost portion of the box model. It creates space around the element.

Coding the margin property works just like coding for the other box model properties. margin is shorthand for the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-left so can accept up to four values. If you only wanted to alter the margin on the right, for example, you would use the margin-right property.

If you give the margin property only one value, then that value of margin will be applied to all four sides of the content.

If you give it two values, then they will be repeated, so the first value applies to the top and bottom and the second to left and right.

If three values are specified, then the first applies to the top, the second to the right and left, the third to the bottom.

All four values are applied clockwise from top to right to the bottom to left. The values can be absolute or relative so px, em, rem and % are allowed.

Adding margin will increase the size of the element so you need to take this into account with respect to your layout. Take a look at the table to below to see some examples.
