Viewport height

Another useful and responsive unit of measurement in CSS is viewport height.

The vh unit relates to the height of the full viewport. For example, 10vh will resolve to 10% of the current viewport height.

Viewport height is useful if you want to constrain your application to the height of the browser viewport. You would use 100vh to do this. Another example is a sticky footer. If you add a min-height: 100vh; to the body element, then your footer will stay at the bottom of the screen even if there is insufficient content to push it down.
