Another useful and responsive unit of measurement in CSS is the % or percentage unit.

The % unit relates to the size of its parent element. For example, if a parent div is set to be 200px wide, and a child div nested inside it is set to be 50% wide, then the child div will display at 50% of its parent's width: 100px.

If the parent width is changed, for example to 400px, then the child with a width of 50% will expand to become 200px wide.

As you can imagine, the percentage unit of measurement is very useful for dealing with designing websites to look good on all the different screen sizes.
